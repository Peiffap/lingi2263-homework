    "## Question 1: Create your own tagger\n",
    "For this exercise, you should recall the resources you've been studying for task 2.1 and then read the following web-page to understand the exact specification of an nltk tagger: https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe that an nltk tagger takes the form of an object in python for which different methods can be called. You should in particular look at the `nltk.UnigramTagger`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_unigram_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As can be seen in the examples above, `nltk.UnigramTagger` can be instantiated by passing as argument either a tagged text in the same format as that of `corpus.tagged_sents()` or with the attribute `model=likely_tags`, where `likely_tags` is a dictionnary where the keys are the words and the values are the most likely tag (the associated tag with highest count in the training text).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you are asked to build a tagger based on a unigram tagger. If care is not taken, many words could be assigned a tag of `None`, because they were not among the words seen during training. How can you solve this to improve performance? We would like to assign a default tag in those cases. In other words, we want to use the unigram tagger first, and if it is unable to assign a tag, then use the default tagger. This process is known as backoff in the nltk package (not to be confused with the concept of backoff smoothing for N-grams). For that, the backoff parameter that can be used when creating the tagger will be key as shown below where it is assumed that the default tag will always be a noun.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "baseline_tagger = nltk.UnigramTagger(model=likely_tags, backoff=nltk.DefaultTagger('NN'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "In our case, you should build a smarter backoff such that it reverts to the most frequent tag associated to the first occurences of each word in the text. In other words, suppose that you pre-process your text by replacing the first occurrence of any word with the `<UNK>` token, the backoff will be the most frequent tag associated to `<UNK>`."
