In other words, a list of tagged sentences each broken down to a list of `(word, tag)` tuples). The `evaluate` method returns a float that represents the accuracy of the tagger. That is, the proportion of tags that were assigned correctly by the tagger on the tested set of tagged sentences.\n",

The answer you provide should be given in the form of a percentage (float number, without the % sign). So for instance, if your tagger has a \"20.2%\" error rate, you should report `20.2`. As usual, you should report the error rate with at least two significant digits."
